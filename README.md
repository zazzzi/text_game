# text_game THE ADVENTURE 

A simpel text based "game" made for an assignment. Try it [here](https://zazzzi.github.io/text_game/)!

The game I've made contains three different path for three different classical fantasy classes. 
Not a lot of focus has been put in to the styling or the storyline (it's a bit "meme'y" from time to times..) since js was the important part of this assignement.
